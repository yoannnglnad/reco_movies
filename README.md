Movie Recommendation System ðŸŽ¬ðŸ¤–

This project implements various movie recommendation techniques, including collaborative filtering and the "most-watched" strategy, to suggest personalized films to users based on their preferences.

Key Features:
Collaborative Filtering: Suggests movies based on similar usersâ€™ preferences (e.g., if you liked "Inception", it recommends movies liked by others with similar tastes).
Most Watched: Recommends movies that have been rated the most, both across all genres and within specific genres.
The goal is to create a dynamic and intelligent movie recommender system, improving user experience through data-driven suggestions.

Technologies:
- python
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numPy
